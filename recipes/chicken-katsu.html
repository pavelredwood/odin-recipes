    <h1>Chicken Katsu</h1>
    <p>Chicken katsu is a Japanese-style fried chicken dish. This is my family recipe that can also be used to make
        tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Traditionally served with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>Using a meat mallet, pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set up a dredging station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with

        <li>Dredge each chicken breast in flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured chicken in the beaten egg, letting any excess drip off.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken generously in panko breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat to reach 350°F (175°C).
        </li>
        <li>Fry the chicken katsu for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain the chicken katsu on a wire rack placed over a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
